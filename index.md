# What we are
A New York City-based meetup providing an opportunity for our region's C++
enthusiasts to socialize, network, and learn together.

We meet in person after regular working hours, roughly once per month. Virtual
attendance options, as well as video recordings, are provided when possible for
those who cannot or do not wish to attend in person.

## What it's like
Our events are rotationally hosted by different companies and universities in
the area. Snacks, refreshments, chances to chat. Events typically center around
talks or presentations by one or more invited speakers.

## Who it's for
Anyone interested in writing C++, with a skew towards those doing so
professionally. Beginners and language lawyers are welcome.

We are committed to creating and maintaining  a safe and inclusive environment
for everyone who attends. All attendees must agree to, and abide by, our
[Code of Conduct](/policy/conduct.html).
