# Code of conduct

## Before anything else...
If you believe you have witnessed or have knowledge of a breach to this code of
conduct by person(s) participating in NYC++ events or online spaces, please
report it to [nycpp-conduct@googlegroups.com](
mailto:nycpp-conduct@googlegroups.com) at your earliest opportunity.

The rest of this document will more precisely define the conduct expected from
participants in NYC++ online spaces and events, as well as our protocol for
acting on such reports. Please reach out to an NYC++ Lead Organizer or Conduct
Committee member if you have any questions or concerns.


## Purpose
A primary goal of the NYC++ meetup is to be inclusive to the largest number of
contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we
are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all,
regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, race, ethnicity, age,
physical appearance, body size, socioeconomic status, political affiliation, and
religion (or lack thereof).

This document outlines our expectations for all who participate in the
community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior. We invite all
those who participate in our events to help us create safe and positive
experiences for everyone.


## Expected behavior
The NYC++ community works to be welcoming and kind among itself and to others,
with a deep commitment to psychological safety, and we want to ensure that
does not change as we grow and evolve. To that end, we have a few ground rules
that we ask all community members to adhere to:

* be welcoming,
* be friendly and patient,
* be considerate,
* be kind,
* be careful in the words that we choose,

This list is not exhaustive. Rather, it is intended to be a guide to make it
easier to communicate and participate in the community.

## Unacceptable behavior
Unacceptable behaviors include, but are not limited to: intimidating, harassing,
abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any
participant in our community. Community event venues may sometimes be shared
with members of the public; all members of the community should be respectful to
all patrons of such locations, and to any staff working therein.

Harassment and other exclusionary behaviors are never acceptable. These include,
but are not limited to:

* Harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual
  orientation, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), disability, physical
  appearance, body size, age, dietary restriction, or political affiliation.
* Inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images (including presentation
  slides).
* Inappropriate depictions of violence (including presentation slides).
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following.
* Harassing photography or recording.
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events.
* Unconsented sharing of personally identifying information (i.e., "doxing").
* Inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
* Advocating for, encouraging, or threatening any of the above behaviors.

No weapons are allowed at NYC++ events. Weapons include, but are not limited to,
explosives (including fireworks), guns, and large knives such as those used for
hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing
injury or harm to others.


## Consequences of unacceptable behavior
Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors, invited
speakers, venue and catering partners, and community organizers, will not be
tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply
immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers
may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban
or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in
the case of a paid event).


## If you witness or are subject to unacceptable behavior
The NYC++ Conduct Committee is responsible for reviewing, investigating, and
responding to all reported incidents that breach this code of conduct. If you
are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns
pertaining to the conduct of individuals belonging to, partnered with, or
otherwise affiliated with the community, please report the incident to the
Conduct Committee at [nycpp-conduct@googlegroups.com](
mailto:nycpp-conduct@googlegroups.com), as soon as possible.

If you would prefer to directly speak with a community organizer, please reach
out to any of the individuals listed on the [Governance page](
/policy/governance.html).
Community organizers are furthermore expected to be available to help community
members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those
experiencing unacceptable behavior to feel safe. In the context of in-person
events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person
experiencing distress.


## Procedure for incident handling
The NYC++ Conduct Committee is responsible for reviewing and investigating all
reports of code of conduct violations, for determining appropriate followup
actions, and for maintaining a private record of all reported incidents.

### Reviewing incidents
You can expect to receive an acknowledgment from the Conduct Committee within
two business days. The Conduct Committee will then review the incident and try
to determine:
* What happened and who was involved.
* Whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation.
* Whether this is an ongoing situation, or if there is a threat to anyoneâ€™s
  physical safety.

If this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to physical safety,
the Conduct Committee's immediate priority will be to protect everyone involved.
This means an "official" response may be delayed until the Conduct Committee
believes that the situation has ended and that everyone is physically safe.

The Conduct Committee will try to contact other parties involved or witnessing
the event to gain clarity on what happened and understand any different
perspectives.

### Responding to incidents
Once the Conduct Committee has a complete account of the events they will make a
decision as to how to respond. Responses may include:
* Nothing, if no violation occurred or it has already been appropriately
  resolved.
* A temporary or permanent ban from participation in the community, inclusive
  of both in-person and online spaces and events.
* Involvement of relevant law enforcement if appropriate.

If the situation is not resolved within one week, the Conduct Committee will
respond to the original reporter with an update and explanation.

Once a response has been determined, the Conduct Committee will separately
contact the original reporter and other individuals to let them know what
actions, if any, will be taken. Feedback from the individuals involved on the
appropriateness of our response will be taken into account, but no additional
action is promised.

After any incident, the Conduct Committee will make an anonymized report on the
situation to the NYC++ Lead Organizers, after having removed all identifying
attributes of individuals involved. In rare cases, the NYC++ Lead Organizers may
choose to make a public statement about the incident; in such cases, the
identities of anyone involved will remain confidential unless instructed
otherwise by those individuals.

### Special cases
If a complaint is raised against a member of the Conduct Committee or
one of the other NYC++ organizers, they will be excluded from conduct discussion
and decisions, including discussion of any appeals. They will only be included
as needed for an involved party, such as to solicit their perspective or to
notify them of decisions. Such complaints may lead to a member's
responsibilities being revoked.


## Addressing grievances
If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of
Conduct, you should notify one of the NYC++ Lead Organizers with a concise
description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with
our existing governing policies.

In general, it is *not* appropriate to appeal a particular decision in spaces
accessible to the public or the wider community of NYC++ attendees, including on
platforms such as GitHub, Discord, or Meetup. Doing so would involve disclosure
of information which should remain confidential.
Disclosing this kind of information publicly may be considered a separate and,
potentially, more serious violation of the code of conduct. This is not meant to
limit discussion of the code of conduct, the conduct team itself, or the
general appropriateness of responses, but please refrain from mentioning
specific facts about incidents without the explicit permission of all parties
involved.


## Scope
All community participants (organizers, paid or otherwise; sponsors; invited
speakers; and other attendees) are expected to abide by this code of conduct in
all community venues - in-person and online - as well as in all one-on-one
communications pertaining to community business.

In rare cases, violations of this code outside of these spaces may affect, and
be detrimental to, a person's ability to participate within these spaces.
Important examples include, but are not limited to, sexual and gender-based
violence and/or harassment, hate crimes, and hate speech. Although we do not
conduct proactive research, we have an obligation to respond to reported and, to
the extent possible, corroborated concerns.

Our motivations are not rooted in responding punitively, or holding people
accountable. Instead, our response will be focused on how the continued
participation of the person at issue could impact the community's safety,
well-being, and inclusivity. It is our priority to remain a welcoming community
to those harmed by such actions, as well as groups subjected to systemic
marginalization or underrepresentation.
