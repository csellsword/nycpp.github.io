# Governance

The NYC++ Meetup is organized by a small team of C++ professionals living and
working in the New York City area.

## Lead Organizers
Organization of NYC++ is led by the following individuals. They oversee all
venue and sponsor outreach, plan and coordinate events, and ensure continuity of
the NYC++ meetup. Meetup policy and decisions (e.g., which venues and sponsors
to partner with) are set by the Lead Organizers.

venue and sponsor outreach, and alleviate some of the planning work from the
Lead Organizers.

## Conduct Committee
We aspire to soon establish a separate and independent committee of volunteers
responsible for reviewing and investigating all reported [Code of Conduct](
/policy/conduct.html) violations, determining appropriate followup actions, and
keeping a private record of all reported incidents.

Until a suitable set of volunteers has been identified, the NYC++ Lead
Organizers will share these responsibilities.
